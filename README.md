## Welcome to GitHub Pages, Friend!

GitHub pages allow for "no code, no worries" solution to hosting your personalized website for free. This is possible by tying that page with your GitHub username, Jekyll that will organize your content into premade style, and the content itself using Markdown syntax.

### Markdown

Markdown is charactarised with text and characters for styling your content, it is as simple as that. Functionalities
could be explored at [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/AbuKhalil95/learning-journal/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
