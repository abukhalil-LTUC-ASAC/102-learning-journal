# So What Is A *git*?
 
Contrary to the name of the file, its not gitgud, not git-up and neither GitHub, its actually "*the stupid content tracker*" named by Linus Trovalds, or an unpleasant person in British slang. When in **good** mood it becomes a "global information tracker", and when it **breaks** it is a "goddamn idiotic truckload of s***"...

Seriously though, git is a distributed version control system (DVCS). The name has 2 parts, distributed as in data storage in multiple locations to avoid security risks and data loss, version control that makes it possible to retrieve and revert to earlier versions and making sure each step is calculated with minimal risk.

This piece.. of software allowed projects of ginormous proportions and hundreds of coders to contribute seamlessly to the code base and make things simply happen much faster and easier.

## How to get started?

The simplest way is to get a GitHub account, and from there add repositries and project files! and every change from now on will be tracked. So what are you waiting for? [Get Started!](https://github.com/)

## Other notes

[Here is a more comprehensive guide](https://www.udemy.com/blog/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/) that shows you details of the git. Including information on how to do git operations from **The Terminal**.

## From the Terminal

It is of outmost important to get a [Full Setup](https://codefellows.github.io/code-201-prework/prework/windows/02_WSL_Ubuntu_setup.html) done and  proper editor or IDE to work with you git imports from the terminal, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that I am currently using with the other coders around me. functions to learn about are:
* **IMPORT/CLONING**
* **Editing The Code**
* **Saving Changes**
* **Checking Status**
* **Committing**
* **Pushing Your Code**

> Well, you may start coding now
