#Learning from Growth Mindset

Starting with some problems I had once I was graduated from school, I had to explore some options to deal with them whilist
continue my education at school. It was obvious at the beginning, some new concepts here and there, tons of workload and life balance, 
new feelings of envy I did not experience before.

Growth mindset concepts could offer some remedy, as in part solution part consolation, kind of similar to our talk at school
and home, about the heroes of old ages and their stories. But instead it talks to us, looks at our problems in a specific personal format
to maximize the impact.
