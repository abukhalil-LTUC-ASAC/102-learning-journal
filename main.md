# Learning from Growth Mindset

Starting with some problems I had once I was graduated from school, I had to explore some options to deal with them whilist
continuing my education at University. It was obvious at the beginning, some new concepts here and there, tons of workload and life balance, new feelings of _envy_ I did not experience before. The major issue is, they were piling up **fast**, with no clearing at sight.

Growth mindset concepts could offer some remedy, as in part solution part consolation, kind of similar to our talk at school
and home, about the heroes of old ages and their stories. But instead, it talks to us, and looks at our problems in a specific and personal format to maximize the impact. 

My own interpretation, other than the one that was beautifully explained in **[This article]**(https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset), is summarized by the ability to see your own miniscule improvements day by day, weeks going on and by the end of the year and still have some sense of pride in it. Seeing achievement in others as a source of inspiration and as a possible co-worker in a future project in mind is paramount in building things.
