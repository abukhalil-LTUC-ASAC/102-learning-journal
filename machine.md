# Tasked To Watch Some Videos!

That's right! Get this [link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-) on and start watching bill gates, being a cool guy that he is<sub>* not an ad*</sub>, introducing a series to know more about computers!

Just to make it easier for you, I had summarized what I understood. **First-next** video shows us the concept of the computer, and why it was needed to lift some repetitive labor and ease work! And how just `input`,`storage`,`processing` and `output` is exactly what machines do. 

**Second-next** hands you the binary in a silver platter, fully explained to show you how `0,1` means everything to the machine, including `text`,`images` and even `sound`!

This next **Third** video is surely physical, turning your `0,1` into *On, Off* electrical signals. By introducing [logic](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/logic_gates.htm) and [calculations](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb_7.html) into these signals, its possible to manipulate your binaries and become the machine! But these logic gates are physical components, and the physical components are numerous and specialized! Which is where the **Fourth** video will become handy.

CPU's for an example, calculates how to show you different types of information depending on the stored data by your memory (eg: RAM) with electrical signals reaching the [speed of light](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/computers-are-becoming-fa/), and into the screen as bits and activate colors with it. Different real life applications require only different inputs and outputs, which will be interpreted through electrical signals that eventually be used to control [motors for movement](https://www.bostondynamics.com/), [vibrations for sound](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/loudspeakers.html) and general [data analysis for customer behavior](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kirimasters/2019/03/20/study-89-of-consumers-are-more-likely-to-buy-products-from-amazon-than-other-e-commerce-sites/#a4759ca4af1e), as explained in the **Final** video with a brief look into hardware-software integration, OS and programming languages and more! Giving you the power in be involved.
