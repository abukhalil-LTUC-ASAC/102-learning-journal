# The What, Who and How to Website!

Understanding **What** is in a website's content, starts with understanding the syntax and structure, purpose and finally the content and design.

Web pages are written in Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML), the basics of html can be summarized as a pair of opening and closing tags that surrounds some content to give it a special order or meaning. These tags also carry *attributes* such as `<div id=mainText class=news>`, it will help classifiying and designing each content depending on its classification.

It is common to discuss the needed work beforehand to exactly know **Who** will use such a website, these are: 
* Are they laywers, teachers or 5th graders?
* Why would they visit your site? For a service, information and etc..?
* In what way can you structure the information they expect to find?
* How often will your site be visited?

Information gathered are then grouped and diffrentiated from each other through HTML and styled ussing Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), with tons of example right in the [Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/).

It is important to note that HTML5 new semantic tags and [Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)](https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo) guidelines should be followed simply for its added **[value](https://www.reliablesoft.net/what-is-search-engine-optimization-and-why-is-it-important/)** in both marketing and better user experience.

Now its time to know the **How**, mostly by looking through a PDF by **[Jon Duckett](https://wtf.tw/ref/duckett.pdf)** called HTML & CSS. But much more can be learned by trail and error!
