# This Is Going To Be Slow

And that is fine, your first serious coding skills will be demonstrated in the next few steps. Take your time and get familiar with the `syntax`. Since this is infact programming, The **ABC**'s are summarized in work before actually touching the code. They are **Define the Goal**, **Design the Script** by splitting complex problems into easy bits and flowcharts and finally code each step!

Coding means bit manipulations, and JS manipulates html and css elements using arithmetic and boolean operators. These manipulations can only happen if you store this data somewhere, which is where `var` comes handy, JS has this unified expression to declare string, int and boolean making your life much easier. Multiple variables can be combines into `Arrays` such as `var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];` reducing code complexity writing multiple variables of a same type (cars).

Functions however, adds more re-usability, since it can be executed with *every single call*. Also makes your code much readable with separate JS functions in each file. They are declared with `function DoThis(){};` with input between `()`, code to execute between `{}` and a return value inside that to give you back a value at the declaration such as `DoThis();` no matter where.
