# Before You Start Coding, Editors

It is paramount to setup the right tools and ideas. As the name suggest, it will be one of multiple important softwares that you will sink hours, *staring at them first, then edit in 10 minutes.* So might aswell choose a pretty tool amirite? 

Looking at some pre-installed pieces, you might notice that it kind of resembles a [white, bear minimum](https://websitesdiy.org/wp-content/uploads/tuts/notepad0001/1-notepad-website.png) of an editor that allows you to write text, but generally nothing else. 
Unless you are looking for painful coding experiences, I would suggest looking at other more complex pieces. This suggestion works because, other than how the environment looks, you would want less time spent debugging and coding too by having the software look for linked functions, and autocomplete lines of code for you to fill in, such as **[ATOM](https://atom.io/)** and **[Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)**. There are even online editors that allows quick sharing of code such as **[JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/OceanXIS/tnpgcw1k/)**.

## An Integrated Development Environment(IDE) 
This however, offers the whole package to you. Including but not limited to [The Editor, Compiler, Debugger, Profiler](https://teckangaroo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screenshot_21.png) for CPU and RAM usages and much more! This huge of a software is sometimes required to be proficient in, depending on your company practices.

## A Review Of Commandline (CMD *for windows*)
That black space of emptiness infront of you? It is actually your direct line to the machine. The commands you input generally allows you to do [almost everything](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php) you could already do without this, so why bother?

Generally speaking, the Terminal could runs scripts to execute multiple commands, seamlessly move around directories and adding files and folders on the fly. These traits and many more could be your new lifestyle of managing a project and *[eventually be absorbed into the machine itself as fluency progresses](https://dev.to/nrobinson2000/why-you-need-terminal-bpd)*.
